# Introduction

During last four decades sea ice extent declines, sea ice becomes younger and thinner [@Stroeve2018]. In this issue we focused on earlier sea ice break-up and later sea ice advance.


# Methods

## Sea ice concentration data

Passive microwave sea ice concentration data [@NASATeam_GSFC] is selected for long-term estimating of variability and trends.

## Isotonic regression

Isotonic unimodal regression [@Turner1997] is used for fitting of SIC time-series. Implemented in package `Iso` [@r-Iso] for R statistical software [@r-core]. Isotonic fitted curve excludes double or multiple crossing threshold value, which was reached in 5% cases of fitted smoothed regional SIC time-series [@SternLaidre2016].

:::aside
> In practice, out of 2736 crossing dates (36 years × 2 seasons × 19 regions × 2 time series
per region), only 131 dates (4.8 %) had any potential for ambiguity.
In more than 95 % of the cases there was clearly only a single crossing date.

## Seasons

Overlapped periods (Figure \@ref(fig:transitions)).

+ "max": winter, period of maximal sea ice extent between `r format(transition$max$from,"%d %B")` and `r format(transition$max$to,"%d %B")`.

+ "mlt": Spring, period of sea ice retreat between `r format(transition$mlt$from,"%d %B")` and `r format(transition$mlt$to,"%d %B")`.

+ "min": Summer, perod of minimal sea ice extent between `r format(transition$min$from,"%d %B")` and `r format(transition$min$to,"%d %B")`.

+ "frz": Autumn, period of sea ice advance between `r format(transition$frz$from,"%d %B")` and `r format(transition$frz$to,"%d %B")`.

```{verbatim, echo=F}
   period <- list(mlt=list(from=as.Date(paste0(year,"-02-15"))
                          ,to=as.Date(paste0(year,"-09-30")))
                 ,frz=list(from=as.Date(paste0(year,"-08-15"))
                          ,to=as.Date(paste0(year+1L,"-03-31"))
                          )
                 ,min=list(from=as.Date(paste0(year,"-07-15"))
                          ,to=as.Date(paste0(year,"-10-31"))
                          )
                 ,max=list(from=as.Date(paste0(year+shift,"-01-15"))
                          ,to=as.Date(paste0(year+shift,"-05-15"))
                          )
                  )[transition]
```

Seasonal sequence for SID is "max", "mlt", "min".

Seasonal sequence for SIA is "min", "frz", "max".

## SIC threshold

We selected SIC `r threshold`, which is abopted from @Parkinson1999. This is common value for estimating sea ice extent [@NSIDC_ice-extent].

## Short-terms states

Comparing summer minimal extent and extent of resident sea ice, we estimated `r stage$summer` as a minimal duration for open-water period during summer.
Comparing winter maximal extent and outer extent without resident open water, we estimated `r stage$winter` as a minimal duration for sea ice period during winter.
If SIC is <`r threshold` for fitted timeseries during `r stage$summer` days or more, then SID and SIA are detected.
If SIC is <`r threshold` for fitted time-series during less than `r stage$summer` days, then resident ice is detected.
If SIC is ≥`r threshold` for fitted timeseries during `r stage$winter` days or more, then SID and SIA are detected.
If SIC is ≥`r threshold` for fitted time-series during less than`r stage$winter` days, then resident open water is detected.

## SIC preprocessing

Spatial (focal) and temporal filling data gaps. 

> *2013*: We developed an algorithm to estimate SID and SIA onset dates using daily SIC data derived from 25-km x 25-km pixel resolution SSM/I and SSMIS passive microwave satellite imagery (Maslanik et al. 1999). We preprocessed the SIC data in two steps:  1) spatial filtering to fill no-data pixels using Gaussian smoothing with a 3x3 pixel window size and $\sigma$=0.75; and 2) temporal linear interpolation to fill remaining no-data pixels using three sequential sliding windows with sizes 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7 pixels.

Invisible for SSM/I and SSMIS scanning instrument Polar belt (approximately north of 86.5°N) is filled by SIC value 100%. For our data () There is no SID or SIA onsets, which are close to polar belt for our data (1988-2021). Each map contains 66285 cells. Coastal buffer zone (1-2 pixel or 25-50 km) are (can be) applied for output.

## Algorithm

Each phenological state (SID or SIA) is considered independently. For each phenological state seasons are considered independently: "max", "mlt", and "min" for SID; "min", "frz", and "max" for SIA. For each season, SIC time-series is approximated by isotonic function with a single mode. Based on fitted time-series, SID is last date when SIC ≥`r threshold`, SIA is first date when SIC ≥`r threshold`.

### Inverting

Generally, two time-series: original $x$ and inverted $100-x$ are fitted. For "max" season only original $x$ is considered. For "min" season only inverted $100-x$ is considered. For "mlt" and "frz" seasons both fittings compete, and fitting with minimal RMSE is selected. Backward transition $100-x$ is applied for inverted fitting.

### Onset quality

Additional numeric value for onset quality, proximity to ends of time-series, is included to interim output for estimating quality of fitting. Proximity to ends is estimated as a fraction between 0.0 and 0.5, where 0.0 means position in the head or tail of time-series, 0.5 means position in the middle of time-series. There is more uncertainty in the proximity to the boundaries of time-series period because of the uncertain time-series behavior beyond considered period.

## Decision making

Because output has length 3, only one value is selected based on maximal value of onset quality.

:::aside
Deprecated:

> For SID "mlt" has higher priority. For SIA "frz" has higher priority. If SIA, then "max" is selected between "min" and "max" competition. 
:::


## Output

Raster maps with two kinds of information.

1. Values between 15 and 600 denote DOY of SID onset or SIA onset.

1. Values greater than 600 are flags.

   + 990: resident sea ice  
   + 980: resident open water 
   + 930: transition  
   
      Below are interim flags for flexible detection of short-term phenological stages:  
      
      + 701-750: lifetime of short-term ice during winter in days with added value 700  
      + 701-750: lifetime of short-term open water during summer in days with added value 800  
      
      After excluding of short-term phenological stages (`r stage$winter` days for sea ice and `r stage$summer` days for open water), values between 701 and `r stage$winter-1+700` are reclassified to 980, values between `r stage$winter+700` and 750 are reclassified to 930, values between 801 and `r stage$summer-1+800` are reclassified to 990, values between `r stage$summer+800` and 850 are reclassified to 930.
      
   <!--
      + 850: algorithm fails to detect transition from open water to sea ice
      + 840: short-term sea ice (duration of period with ice is less than `slen` days)
      + 830: short-term open water (duration of period without ice is less than `slen` days)  
      + 820: sometimes SIC drops <`r threshold` but fitting doesn't drops this threshold  
      + 810: sometimes SIC raises ≥`r threshold` but fitting doesn't raises this threshold  
      
      Flags 880, 830, and 820 are interpreted as resident ice.
   -->

1. Values greater than 6500 are dates with origin `r format(ursa:::.origin(),"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")`.

## Quality assessment

We developed two kind of maps for consequent interleaving.

+ Difference between SIA dates and SID dates -- length of open water season

+ Difference between SID dates and SIA dates -- length of ice season



# Mapping

Output example is illustrated on Figure \@ref(fig:onsets).

```{r onsets, fig.cap="Consequence of phenological seasons"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/onsets.png",dpi=48)
```

## Comparison with 


+ Using ‘nugget’ (variogram parameter), spatial autocorrelation

   + SID *vs* first/second/third day when SIC drops below `r threshold`.

   + SID *vs* date when "At least three consequent days with SIC<`r threshold`". 

+ Difference in days between snowmelt onset and SID.

# Application

## Data compression

For any date (in units of DOY) of transitional period SIE is restored by overlapping mask with values ≤DOY and mask with flag of resident ice.

Single map instead of seasonal set (about three hundred maps) of sea ice extent maps. See comparison on Figure \@ref(fig:cumextent). Tails of isotonic SID and SIA curvesare limited by minimal and maximal values of onset.

```{r cumextent, fig.cap="Evolutions of SIE (grey) from SIC and restored SIE from SID (red) and SIA (blue) maps"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/cumextent.png",dpi=250)
```

## Polar bears behaviour

+ As a metric for polar bear habitat.

+ Polar bear subpopulation choropleths. 

+ Scatterplot (Figure \@ref(fig:telemetry)), X-value is date of polar bear location, Y-value is SID/SIA.

```{r telemetry, fig.cap="How to polar bear adapt to sea ice break-up"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/telemetry.png",dpi=300)
```
:::note
Figure \@ref(fig:telemetry) is apopted from @Rozhnov2017_hutuda. Would be better to use permitted data, like @Pagano2021_CRW.
:::

## Isodates

This is mapping too (Figure \@ref(fig:inversedem)).

+ Direction of SID/SIA

+ Speed of SID/SIA (km day^-1^).

+ Contour lines, where units are dates or DOY.

```{r inversedem, fig.cap="Extracted parameters from SID map"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/inversedem.png")
```

## Snow freeze onset 

Early freeze onset and freeze onset estimates [@Markus_PMW_data] based on passive microwave data [@Markus2009_PMW]. Similar to MDSDA [@Belchansky2004_RSE; @Rigor2000].

+ Current state: PMW freeze onset verification by SIA dates.

+ Proposed state: Masking of seasonal and resident ice. Freeze onset makes sense only for resident ice, whereas SIA can be used for seasonal ice.

# Discussion

## "Resident ice" term

We used "resident" ice instead of summer minimum. 

## Monitoring tasks

Near real-time data for monitoring tasks. For mapping "near" means couple weeks for regions with seasonal ice and months for regions with close proximity to MYI

+ SIC in 25 km grid [@NASATeam_NRT].
   
+ SIC in 6.25 km grid [@Bremen_iceconc; @Bremen_ASI5].

Time-series of ice-charts (e.g., @USNIC_MIZ, [Norwegian](https://cryo.met.no/en/ice-charts-client)^[TODO bibliography citation] and [American](https://www.weather.gov/afc/ice)^[TODO bibliography citation] ice charts) can be applied too BUT with additional expert conversion quantitative data (ice type, category of ice fraction) to qualitative data (ice concentration)
